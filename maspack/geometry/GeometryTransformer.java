/**
 * Implements geometric transformations associated with a generalized
 * deformation mapping, under which points <code>p</code> are mapped
 * to deformed points <code>p'</code> using a function
 * <pre>
 * p' = f (p)
 * </pre>
 * The mapping is assumed to be piece-wise differentiable, so
 * that each point <code>p</code> is also associated with a
 * deformation gradient <code>F</code>.
 *
 * The transformations can be applied to a variety of primitives, including
 * points, vectors, planes, meshes, and transformation matrices. Sub-classes
 * provide different types of transformations, include rigid, affine, and
 * non-linear.
 *
 * <p>The transformations themselves are effected with a set of
 * <code>transform()</code> methods, one for each primitive type.  Primitives
 * of type {@link Point3d} and {@link Vector3d} are transformed using
 * primitives named <code>transformVec()</code> and
 * <code>transformPnt()</code>, to help resolve ambiguities between point and
 * vector transformations.
 *
 * <p>The transformer is able to save and restore the previous values associated
 * with each transformation, so that its transform actions can later be
 * "undone". Storing of save information is activated by calling
 * <code>setUndoState(UndoState.SAVING)</code>, after which each transform
 * operation will save the original value of each primitive. Restoring of this
 * information is then activated by calling
 * <code>setUndoState(UndoState.RESTORING)</code>, after which each transform
 * operation will restore the original primitive value instead of performing
 * the actual transformation. For example:
 * <pre>
 *   GeometryTransformer gtr;
 *   Vector3d v1, v2;
 *   Plane plane;
 *   
 *   ... initialize variables ...
 *   
 *   // start saving undo information
 *   gtr.setUndoState (UndoState.SAVING); 
 *   gtr.transformVec (v1);  
 *   gtr.transformVec (v2);  // transform v1, v2, and plane
 *   gtr.transform (plane)
 *
 *   // restore undo information
 *   gtr.setUndoState (UndoState.RESTORING); 
 *   gtr.transformVec (v1);                
 *   gtr.transformVec (v2);   // restore v1, v2, and plane to their
 *   gtr.transform (plane)    // original values
 * </pre>
 * When restoring undo information, operations must be called on the same
 * primitives in the same order as was used during the original transform. It
 * is the responsibility of the calling application to ensure this. The caller
 * may also save and restore additional application-specific information using
 * the primitives {@link #saveObject} and {@link #restoreObject}.
