Note that when changing builds between 32 and 64 bit systems, the .obj
files should be cleaned because otherwise they may be incompatible.

MKL 11 1.3 (version 1, update 3) and higher versions contain Pardiso
modifications that prevent hybrid solves from working properly using
the undocumented interface described to us by Olaf.

To obtain MKL download, log in to Intel Registration center
(john_e_lloyd), and then download the desired composer executable.

For MKL 11 1.2, the file is w_ccompxe_2013_sp1.2.176.exe

An NMakefile32 file has been created for building 32-bit libraries. To
use it, open an IA-32 command prompt configured for the 32bit
compiler:

Start > All programs > Intel Parallel Studio XE 2013 > 
    Command Prompt > Parallel Stuido XE with Intel Compiler > 
        IA-32 Visual Studio 2013 mode

Then within this window do:

> cd %ARTISYNTH_HOME%\src\maspack\solvers\lib
> nmake /F NMakefile32

The Intel compiler for Windows is available as Intel Composer XE 2013.

In order to work properly, it requires a companion installation of
Visual Studio. Visual Studio Express 2012 or higher is sufficient to
allow for both 32 and 64 bit compilation from the command line.
Visual Studio Express should be installed *before* Composer because
the Composer install sequence will use that to determine what command
line facilities (both 32 and 64 bit) can be put in place.

To call the intel compiler from the command line, one should open a
specially configured terminal with the appropriate environment set.
For example:

Start > All programs > Intel Parallel Studio XE 2013 > 
    Command Prompt > Parallel Stuido XE with Intel Compiler > 
        Intel 64 Visual Studio 2013 mode

A batch file that sets the environment is found in C:\Program Files
(x86)\Intel\Composer XE 2013 SP1\bin\compilevars

An 'x86' command line environment will allow 32 bit compilation, while
the 'Intel 64' command line environment will allow 64 bit compilation.
The first install of Composer was done before Visual Studio Express
2013 had been installed and so 64 bit compilation was not available.

In order to check whether an obj file is compiled for 32 or 64 bit,
one can use dumpbin, which is part of Visual Studio and is
available from the special shell:

  dumpbin /headers application.exe | findstr "magic machine"
       14C machine (x86)
           32 bit word machine
 OR
  dumpbin /headers application.exe | findstr "magic machine"
       8664 machine (x64)
           20B magic # (PE32+)

When using the command line environment, it is useful to reset
the prompt. This can be done by setting the environment variable
PROMPT to something like "$p$_$g"

Compilation can be set up easily using nmake, with reads a Makefile
just like Unix make. nmake is also part of Visual Studio and is
available on the special command line.

To build the Pardiso library, open an 'Intel 64' command window,
then

> cd %ARTISYNTH_HOME%\src\maspack\solvers\lib
> nmake /F NMakefile

Linker-specific options must come at the end, after the /link
option. Linker options are documented elsewhere, as part of the
general MicroSoft documentation. One such option is /LIBPATH, which
serves the same role as -L on unix.
