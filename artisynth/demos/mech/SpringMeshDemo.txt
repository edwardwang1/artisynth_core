Demonstrates mass-spring systems interacting with constraints.

There are two mass-spring systems (one with green particles
and one with red particles), and a pair of constraints that
can be activated using a check box panel that appears
alongside the main viewer.  Unconstrained, the particle
systems simply fall under gravity.  Activating the
attachment constraint attaches one green particle to a fixed
point in space and connects another green particle to a red
one.  Adding the collision constraint creates a soft-contact
collision interaction with a plane perpendicular to the z
axis.
