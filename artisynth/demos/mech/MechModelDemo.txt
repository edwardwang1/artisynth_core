A central feature of ArtiSynth is it's MechModel package, which allows
the creation of mechanical models composed of point masses, springs,
dampers, rigid bodies, and bilateral and unilateral constraints
between rigid bodies. In this example, a two rigid bodies are
connected by a revolute joint (bilateral constraint), with the first
link suspended from a fixed plate using two springs (green lines). As
the assembly falls under gravity, it comes into contact with one or
two planes (unilateral constraints), which constrain its motion until
it eventually comes to rest.
